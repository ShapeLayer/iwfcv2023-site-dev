**The International Workshop on Frontiers of Computer Vision (IW-FCV) is the exciting chance and place for inter-communication and discussion through many presentations of the advanced researches from the worldwide research communities of computer vision theory, applications, deep learning and big data.**  

IW-FCV 2021 was originally going to be held in Daegu, South Korea. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented changes in our personal and professional lives. As you are aware, we have decided to transform the face-to-face version of IW-FCV 2021 into an online event. We remain committed to the IW-FCV series in 2021 and for this reason, we are offering a fully online conference experience starting from 22-23 February 2021. We are fully aware that our face-to-face meeting is and will remain the ideal format to share knowledge and research however, in light of the pandemic, we see the online conference as the best alternative to keep the spirit of our global community alive.  

We are extremely grateful to our organizing committee who have been so supportive in the decision to proceed with the conference online and we know attendees will value the opportunity to engage and network in the online format.
